# Introduction

This is a rainmeter skin that runs on the original polybar skin by Khanhas (https://github.com/khanhas/Polybar)
To install, drag and drop the 'Amana for Polybar' folder into your Rainmeter skins folder.
Once loaded, the top bar will appear.

To change the look and feel of the bar e.g. colours, fonts, width and positioning, right-click on the bar and select 'Edit Style.'
You can use the inbuilt sliders and colour selectors, or select 'Open config file' to edit the ini yourself.

To add or remove modules from the bar, and change their position, click on 'Edit Modules.' You can also edit individual modules inc files from here.



# Colours & Opacity

1) Bar bg colour
2) Text colour
3) Accent colour
4) Module bg colour

The opacity slider only affects the bar background.



# Notes

- Do not edit the ini files in the 'Setting' folder; these only affect their respective gui, not the actual bar.
- If you want the startmenu to actually open below the startmenu button, you need to move your taskbar to the top of your screen, then use Nexus Dock or something with a similar function to hide it. That will allow the startmenu to open below polybar without your taskbar showing.
- To allow Spotify to work with the music module, these instructions have worked perfectly for me: https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Guide-for-Rainmeter-user

Many thanks to Khanhas for developing the Polybar skin, and to Niivu for reviving Amana.
